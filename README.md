## you can delete the forked repo after the changes have been merged..


Why is the git push command rejected, and how do you deal with it?
you have to "fetch first." Use the commands:

git fetch origin main  
And follow these steps to merge:

git pull origin main  
git add .
git commit -m 'your commit message'
git push origin main
